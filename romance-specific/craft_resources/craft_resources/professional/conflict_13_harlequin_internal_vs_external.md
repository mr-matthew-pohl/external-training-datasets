Depth, relatability and sizzling spice, too: these characters are determined to live their best lives — and find the romance that makes them feel seen, unapologetically. In the pages of Afterglow Books, characters from all walks of life, all types of diverse identities, will pursue their dreams and discover love isn’t far behind. Because everyone deserves a happily ever after that’s true to who they are.
Key Elements:
Strong, driven protagonists who want to be the best versions of themselves. Whether they’re confident about the lives they’ve made or still figuring out who they are, they work through their flaws and meet their challenges, no matter how difficult. Their personal journey moves the plot forward just as much as their romantic journey.
Romantic arcs that are sexy and full of heart; the romances in these stories have emotional strength, electric chemistry and immerse you in the characters’ world.
When the chemistry ignites, it does not stop; whether your story is a slow burn or a raging inferno, the attraction is clear, and the tension is palpable every moment the characters are together. Sex scenes are explicit, but down-to-earth—they bring the reader into the character’s thoughts, feelings, experiences and sensations using everyday language without euphemisms.
In these stories, romance is not the solution to the protagonist’s problems, but it’s a key support system that empowers them to overcome their challenges and discover just how happy and fulfilled they can be.
Conflicts and situations can be remarkable or true-to-life, but they are always grounded in reality; whether it’s issues with family or friends, career, identity or community, the challenges these characters face reflect the diversity of experiences in our world.
Tone ranges from flirtatious, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy to angsty, highly emotional drama that reflects the complex struggles of real life.
Any location in the world can be home to these stories – whether it’s a well-known city or country or a special location that readers would love to learn more about.
Characters can be of any identity, background, or place in life. Their professions can be traditional blue- or white-collar jobs or unusual callings that reflect their individual talents. These romances are a window into the characters’ passions outside the romantic relationship.
No paranormal, romantic suspense, dark or historical romances, or billionaires at this time.
Featured in this line:
Sexy romances that take you through the joys and challenges of creating a happily-ever-after today. These characters come from all walks of life. They live their truth and build relationships that match the life they want. Diversity is a staple component of all Harlequin lines, and in this line, you’ll see it reflected in each month’s releases. You will see characters who reflect your drive and daily trials, and who experience the searingly spicy romances they deserve. New twists on familiar stories – as well as plots you may never have experienced before – will prove a happy ending is not out of reach even when things get tough.
This line is…
Proof that happy endings are meant for everyone
Explicitly sexy with chemistry that pops
Unique plots and strong emotional conflicts that embrace the world around us
The journey of complex characters who aren’t afraid to make mistakes or stand up for what they believe in
We’re actively seeking books from authors of underrepresented backgrounds – if you feel that’s you, and you’re ready to create a sexy contemporary romance with compelling, relatable characters, we’d love to hear from you!

Wholesome, fun and feel-good contemporary romances set in close-knit communities where the reader can escape to a world of love and belonging. Fall in love with small towns, friendly neighborhoods and romances that always end with happily ever after!
Heartwarming Key Elements
Clean, sweet, feel-good stories that readers can share with friends and family of all ages.
Contemporary romances with a focus on family and community. Popular themes include: small towns, coming home, becoming a family (single parents, children and secret babies), holidays (Christmas, Thanksgiving), western elements (cowboys and ranchers), traditional romance themes such as marriage of convenience and fake relationship, and pets or animals.
Characters are everyday men and women with traditional values facing the challenges of modern life and relationships with courage and hope. Heroes are dependable, loyal and honest, with jobs such as firefighter, sheriff, small-town cop, rancher or vet. Heroines are optimistic, empathetic and independent, with strong ties to the people and world around her. We welcome characters with a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and challenges.
Settings are North American small towns or close-knit communities within cities.
Although the developing romance between the hero and heroine is always the focus, Heartwarming’s longer word count allows the author to show the family and friends around the central couple. Subplots featuring best friends, siblings, coworkers and neighbors are welcome and help create a community that readers will want to escape to again and again.
Heartwarming romances feature a low sensuality level. Hugs and kisses only. Still, lots of romantic attraction and tension is required!
No explicit or behind-closed-doors sex, nudity, pre-marital sex, profanity or graphic depictions of violence.
No explicit religious or Christian content. No paranormal. No heavy suspense.
Harlequin Heartwarming is…
The warmth, optimism and small-town family and community feel of TV shows like Nonnas, Gilmore Girls, Virgin River, Schitt's Creek and Ted Lasso.

Key Elements
A Harlequin Romance novel takes the reader into a world of glamour and romance. These are trope-driven romantic escapes with a contemporary fairy tale feel.
The key to a Harlequin Romance heroine is that she's real and down to earth. She's one the reader can believe in, relate to and root for!
We need a hero who exudes extreme wealth and who we can immediately trust, who is worthy of the heroine. He should be strong, gorgeous, and alpha but still be an emotionally accessible man who our heroine would aspire to be with.
Glamorous, international settings are central to our stories bringing the aspirational element to our romances.
High sensual tension, matched with high emotional connection. While these stories do not have gratuitous sexual detail, we welcome scenes that go beyond the bedroom door to explore the emotional fulfillment that comes with sexual intimacy.

Highly couple-focused with minimal secondary characters to generate emotional depth and intensity.
Delivers contemporary, fresh takes on popular romance themes and commercial tropes.
While these are emotional stories, they are also intense, and can be edge-of-the-seat exciting! Throw your reader straight into the story!
